# MoSDH - Modelica Solar District Heating library

## Library for simulation of solar district heating systems with underground thermal energy storage:
- Renewable and conventional energy sources: solar thermal, geothermal, electric, fossile and waste heat energy source models
- Seasonal and short-term storage: pit storage, borehole storage and tank storage models
- System modelling focus: component models include all required sub-components (pumps, sensors, ...) to make the construction of robust system models more simple.
- Uses **Modelica Standard Library version 4.0**
- Based on Modelica.Thermal.FluidHeatFlow and Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer
- Tested succesfully in OpenModelica v1.20, SimulationX 4.3 and Dymola 2021x
